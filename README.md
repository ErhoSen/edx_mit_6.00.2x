### About this Course

6.00.2x is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity. We have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics, so that they will have an idea of what’s possible when the time comes later in their career to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal. That said, it is not a “computation appreciation” course. Students will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. Topics covered include plotting, stochastic programs, probability and statistics, random walks, Monte Carlo simulations, modeling data, optimization problems, and clustering.

Recomended textbook. The recommended textbook for this course is: Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, Revised and Expanded edition, by John Guttag (MIT Press, 2013). Professor Guttag’s book is priced at an affordable $25.00 and is available in both print and e-book editions wherever books are sold.

Special offer for edX students. The MIT Press is offering enrolled students of 6.00x a special price of $17.50 (a 30% discount) on books ordered directly through the publisher’s website. To take advantage of this offer, please use promotion code guttag30.
